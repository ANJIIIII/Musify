# Musify
The player has the capability of playing a song and displays a playlist, pauses, and
resumes, playing the previous or next song. The player can recognize a song that is
being played and show its details on the screen. This project combines the power
 of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a visually appealing and user-friendly
music player interface.
